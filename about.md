# OBJECTIVES

***To Interact:***

In civil engineering department interaction among the students is almost negligible. Therefore, one of the motives of forming CEAS is to increase the interaction of students among each other.

***Group Discussions:***

Here, group discussion means discussion regarding the subjects that civil engineering students are studying and the development of the civil engineering.

***Co-curricular activities:***

CEAS believe that in student’s life apart from studying, a little bit of fun activities plays a very important role as well.

# PREFERRED TIME

As CEAS understands the fact that the time is major obstacle coming in between the society and the classes, therefore, in order to get rid of this problem, CEAS has decided to have the library periods during which it can execute the society’s motives.
Since the library periods are the most suitable interval for the society, CEAS requests you to put it in the end of the time table as per the convenience. 

# FEATURES
1. Practical knowledge of the subject in a fun way.
2. Experience shared by the seniors to the juniors to help. 
3. Seminars by the students.
4. Events. [inter college]
5. Proper organization and contribution of the events not just in the campus but also in the hostel for the students.
6. With the help of the contribution of student workshops can brought to the campus.

# RULES 
**Only civil engineering students are allowed to be the member of this society later in future CEAS can also collaborate with the architectural department.**
